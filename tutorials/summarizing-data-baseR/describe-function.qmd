title: "Using the describe function"
---


```{r, echo = FALSE}
stocks <- read.csv(here::here("data", "stocks.csv"), header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".", na.string = c("", "NA"))
```



The `summary()` function provides a handy overview of descriptive statistics. There is also another function that can do the same thing, and also provides a little more information: `describe()` from the `psych` package. We need to install the `psych` package once and then can load it via the library command. 

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
install.packages("psych")
library(psych)

describe(stocks)
```

Here we can also see, for example, the number of observations per variable (`n`) and the range (the difference between the minimum and maximum values observed).
