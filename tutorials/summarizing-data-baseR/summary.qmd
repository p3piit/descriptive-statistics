title: "Summary"
---

In this tutorial we covered how to request descriptive statistics in R

-   Using mean(), min(), max(), and sd() for a single variable
-   Using summary() for an entire dataset or a selection of variables
-   And using describe() from the psych library for slightly different descriptive statistics

Summary statistics are mostly used for numeric data. If we want to summarize categorical variables, we can use frequency tables. We will have a look at this in the next tutorial of this module.
