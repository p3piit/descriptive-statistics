```{r, echo = FALSE}
songs <- read.csv2(here::here("data", "songs.csv"),header=TRUE, sep=",")
```

Next to making frequency tables of one variable, we can also look at how often specific values on two variables occur together. We use cross tablulations for this purpose. Cross tabulations use the `table()` command again but then on two variables: 

```{r}
table(songs$THEME, songs$YEAR)
```

In this cross tabulation we can see which themes in songs occurred how often in which years.
