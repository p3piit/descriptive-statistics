-   In R, we can create frequency tables using table(), prop.table(), and cumsum().
-   Sometimes you can use exclude = NULL. Think carefully about what this means for your interpretation of the content!
-   We mainly use frequency tables for variables at the nominal/ordinal level.
-   Frequency tables include frequencies, but proportions, percentages, and cumulative proportions/percentages can also be added.

Frequency tables are mainly used to clearly display categorical variables (nominal/ordinal), especially if you want to see the specific numbers. In other cases, it is usually smarter to use summary statistics or a visualization (e.g., a histogram).
