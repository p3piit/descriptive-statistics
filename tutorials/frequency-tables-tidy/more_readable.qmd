title: "Making Frequency Tables More Readable"
---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
songs <- read.csv2(here::here("data", "songs.csv"),header=TRUE, sep=",")
```

Tidyverse frequency tables are already clean, but you can enhance readability. For example, you might rename columns:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
songs %>%
  count(THEME) %>%
  rename(
    frequency = n,
    music_theme = THEME
  )
```

Or format percentages neatly:

```{r}
songs %>%
  count(THEME) %>%
  mutate(
    percentage = paste(n / sum(n) * 100, "%")
  ) %>%
  rename(
    frequency = n,
    music_theme = THEME
  )
```

You can also pipe the result directly into `knitr::kable()` or `gt::gt()` for presentation-quality tables in reports.
