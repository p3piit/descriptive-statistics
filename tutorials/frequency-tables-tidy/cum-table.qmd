title: "Cumulative Proportion Table"

```{r, echo = FALSE}
songs <- read.csv2(here::here("data", "songs.csv"),header=TRUE, sep=",")
```

Cumulative proportions are useful when categories have a meaningful order—such as ratings or levels of satisfaction. 
We can compute them with `cumsum()`:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
songs %>%
  count(THEME) %>%
  mutate(
    prop  = n / sum(n),
    cum_prop = cumsum(prop)
  )
```

This produces a table showing the distribution and how it accumulates across categories.

If the categories are not already ordered, you may want to `arrange()` them before computing the cumulative values.
