By finishing this module, you’ve learned how to explore your data in R using both base functions and tidyverse tools. You can now compute summary statistics, build frequency tables, handle missing values, and reshape your data with pivoting. These skills give you a clear picture of how your dataset is structured and prepare you for deeper analysis in the modules ahead.

## Next Steps

Often it is useful and more intuitive to provide a visual summary of your data. Check out the Basic Visualization Module for this purpose.
